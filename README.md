# What is SharruBot?
SharruBot started out as a small project for me to learn python while also creating something I would find useful for myself, coded entirely in python 3.8 and connecting using websocket.

# Why?
I have a tendency to stream quite often with some of my friends, we've always lamented the lack of a unified output to view all our twitch chats in the same window, so... I set about to make one, which is when the idea for SharruBot was born.

# How do I use SharruBot?
Simply download the bot, then set up your CONFIG.txt (information is provided inside CONFIG.txt) and your PERMISSIONS.txt (Again, pretty simple) then run the SharruBot.py, there's really not much else other than that

# What are SharruBot's commands?
Currently, the commands are limited to mostly functional uses, they are:
- !bye - Shuts down the bot
- !connect 'stream name' - connects SharruBot to someone else's chat to display in the bot's console window
- !part 'stream name' - removes SharruBot from the specified stream
- !toggle - Toggles SharruBot's function to display other people's chat in your own twitch chat
- !chats - Shows which stream chats SharruBot is currently connected to
- !shoutout 'stream name' - a simple shoutout command that links to a stream
